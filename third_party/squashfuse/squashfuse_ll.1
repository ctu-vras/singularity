.Sh NAME
.Nm squashfuse_ll
.Nd mount a SquashFS archive with low-level FUSE
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl o Ar options
.Ar archive
.Ar mountpoint
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
mounts the SquashFS filesystem using FUSE
.Ar archive
on the directory
.Ar mountpoint .
It is generally compatible with 
.Xr squashfuse 1
but it uses the higher performance low-level FUSE interface
and it supports multi-threading.
.Pp
See the
.Xr squashfuse 1
man page for options.  Note that some of the
.Xr fuse 8
library options are only supported on high-level FUSE and so do not apply.
These additional options are also supported, including some that are normally
supported only in high-level FUSE:
.Bl -tag -width -indent
.It Fl o Cm timeout=N
idle N seconds for automatic unmount
.It Fl o Cm uid=N
set file owner to uid N
.It Fl o Cm gid=N
set file group to gid N
